# 1. Problem Statement

In the era of overwhelming entertainment choices, users often struggle to find movies that align with their unique tastes and preferences. Traditional recommendation systems rely on basic filtering techniques, which may not fully capture the complexity of human interests and emotional connections. This project aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by leveraging AI matchmaking algorithms to deliver highly personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences, behavior, and contextual factors.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Build an AI-based recommendation engine tailored to individual movie preferences.
- Use user profiles, ratings, and viewing history to predict relevant movie suggestions.
- Explore collaborative and content-based filtering, and advanced AI matchmaking approaches.
- Evaluate the system for precision, recall, and user satisfaction.
- Simulate a personalized movie recommendation experience in a prototype.

## 3. Scope

- **User Inputs:** Genre preferences, past ratings, watch history, emotional context.
- **Models Used:** Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid systems with neural networks.
- **Limitations:** Offline simulations only (no live platform integration); synthetic user profiles.
- **Outcome:** An interactive prototype/dashboard showcasing recommendations.

## 4. Data Sources

- **Dataset:** MovieLens 100K  
- **Source:** [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  
- **Features:** User IDs, movie titles, genres, user ratings, timestamps.

## 5. High-Level Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Download MovieLens dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, format data, normalize ratings.
3. **EDA:** Analyze user behavior, genre popularity, and trends.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Interaction matrices, average rating, genre affinity.
5. **Modeling Techniques:**
   - Content-based filtering
   - Collaborative filtering (user-user, item-item)
   - Matrix Factorization (e.g., SVD)
   - Neural networks (deep learning embeddings)
6. **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, precision@k, recall@k.
7. **Visualization:** Recommendation lists, similarity scores, heatmaps.
8. **Deployment (Optional):** Prototype using Streamlit or Gradio.
